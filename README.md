# How to use Remote Package Installer
This is only compatible with PS4 firmware that can run Flatz's Remote Package Installer app. Split update PKG files are currently not supported.

- Open the program settings.
- Set the IP addresses for your PC and PS4.
- Install Node.js and the http-server module (Ensure that Node.js is allowed through the firewall).
- If you are unable to install the http-server module via the PS4 PKG Tool, try restarting the PS4 PKG Tool and reinstalling the module. Alternatively, you can manually install it by running the command `npm install http-server -g` in the command prompt.
- Save the changes and exit the program settings.
- Launch the Remote Package Installer app on your PS4.
- Select the PKG file you wish to install, right-click on it, and choose 'Send PKG to PS4'.
